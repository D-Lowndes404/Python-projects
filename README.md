# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Darren, interested in Computers, Automotive, and a few other things. You'll find a collection of my projects, contributions, and explorations here.

## About Me

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Python.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting the basics of Python down with self-teaching.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything automotive, I like a good conversation about quite a few things, just throw the topic out.

## Projects

Here are some projects I'm proud of:

I'm currently working on some of my first test projects to put here

- [My first calculator](Link to Project 1) - Pretty straight forward. The first piece of code I tried, fixed, and got it to work.

## Contributions

I currently do not have any contributions, but as I learn more I'd like to add to this

## Hobbies

At home I just like to type, I have to be doing something with my hands and make up for it by trying to increase my typing speed (avg 75 wpm).
I also like going to car shows and meets to see the different builds of cars and talk with the owners. I have an eye for detail and like to take pictures when I can.
I have a general interest in a bit of everything and like learning new things when I can.
