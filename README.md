# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Darren, interested in Computers, Automotive, and a few other things. You'll find a collection of my projects, contributions, and explorations here.

## About Me

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Python.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting the basics of Python down with self-teaching.

## Projects
Zero at the moment but will look to build this

## Contributions

I currently do not have any contributions, but as I learn more I'd like to add to this

## Hobbies

At home I just like to type, I have to be doing something with my hands.
I also like going to car shows and meets to see the different builds of cars and talk with the owners.
I have a general interest in a bit of everything and like learning new things when I can.

Please feel free to explore my repositories and reach out to me. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts!
